# STFM (Simple TXT File Merger)

## STFM is a simple program made in python to merge two txt files into one using '-'

# Requirements
- Python 3.8 or newer
- Tkinter Library (Usually Included In Python 3.8 or newer)

# How To Use
- First you need to have your 2 .txt files ready to merge (also the merging does not delete the files provided after)
- And then you need to create a new .txt file which needs to be empty for an example: 'merged.txt' (because if you just specify your desktop folder the access will be denied and the program might crash)
- After that you have to specify the path manually or using the file explorer thru this program
- Then just click 'Merge Files' to merge them

# Why did i create this program?
because i once ran into some trouble of making two .txt files into one and because it was like 480 lines of definitions of some sort doing it manually would be long so i made this program to make this process faster so if you have some files to merge together this program will help you, also you are more than welcome to get this program and modify it just like you want it to be!

# Also this program doesnt have and will not have a lincense so you do not have to worry about any limitations of use
